What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem was dealing with an unsorted vector that had to be sorted and printed for the user to view.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I fixed the issue by loading a csv file of the data into a vector structure, sorting that vector and then printing it. If I did not have an understanding of which data structure was best for this project, I would have potentially run into issues with sorting or run-time.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My biggest roadblock was loading the file and making sure each element loaded into the vector properly. To resolve this I went to tutors, watched YouTube videos of other programmers who parsed a csv file, and went to classmates to discuss our similar challenges with the project. Talking to people and thinking out loud made a huge difference in finding my solution.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project has made me realize I know nearly nothing about programming. While I have the basics taught from introductory courses at SNHU, I have a LOT of work to do in my free time if I want to have an easier time with such projects in the future. I'm glad I got the wake up call from this project and I look forward to practicing even more with C++, Python and other languages.

I saw the recommendation of codingame.com and I plan to use that in the future. I also would love more recommendations for youtube channels or other websites that host coding challenges. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I learned more about adaptability from previous assignments than this project, so I'll discuss that. I was fascinated by how the pre-written code was so similar for each assignment, even as we worked on completely different data structures for each one. I hope to be able to create code like that in the future to make things easier for myself and other coders.
